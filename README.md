# T-Dagger Arena Hotkeys

## Overview
This guide helps you remap hotkeys for the **T-Dagger Arena T-TGK321** keyboard using **AutoHotkey (AHK)**. Since the keyboard lacks dedicated software, AHK allows you to customize key behavior for a smoother experience.

## Setup

### 1. Install AutoHotkey
If you havenâ€™t installed AutoHotkey yet, download it from [autohotkey.com](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and install the latest version.

### 2. Auto-Start the Script on Boot
To ensure your AHK scripts run automatically at startup:

1. Press **Win + R**, type `shell:startup`, and press **Enter**.
2. Copy and paste your **`.ahk`** files into the folder that opens.
3. Restart your computer to verify that the scripts run automatically.

## Notes
- You can edit `.ahk` files anytime to modify or add new key remaps.
